# Lost in space

Please be aware that pressing the enter button without entering the recquired choices might result in a crash. The game is also case-sensitive, which mean that your inputs should be written in lower or higher cases accordingly.

Finally, keep in mind that there are no saves for added difficulty. You will however reach several checkpoints during the game where your life will be restored.

I tried to code a text base RPG on python during my free time. 

I would recommend you to run it through CMD or pycharm for a better game experience. Maybe, someday, I'll work on a full 2D, 2.5D or 3D game in godot, but it'll have to wait a bit.

Nothing too fancy, but I hope you'll enjoy !
